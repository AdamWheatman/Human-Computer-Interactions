This website was created to satisfy the breifing:

Create a Web-based system for a takeaway company. The system should be capable of handling and managing their stock lists, customer data, and in-store orders.
The system should be Multi-Lingual along with accomadating for staff who have accessability requirements. 
** This does not need to be an E-Commerce system **
The Web-Based system should created using HTML, CSS, PHP, and a MYSQL database. 
Ensure that accessability and User Experience is at the center of the design

This was created in my Third Year of University.
